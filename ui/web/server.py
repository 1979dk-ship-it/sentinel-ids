"""FastAPI server for the SENTINEL web dashboard.

Runs as its own process (`python -m ui.web`), fully decoupled from the
capture core. The core (main.py) writes alerts to SQLite; this server only
*reads* them. Nothing here touches the detectors, the packet queue, or the TUI.

This file is the application factory. The actual server launch lives in
__main__.py, so create_app() stays importable (e.g. for tests) without the
side effect of binding a port.
